### Perfect for beginners to learn the basics using this tutorial: [Expo Official Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/)

- Built using expo-cli
- Expo framework

> What is [expo](https://expo.dev/) ?

> Brilliant tool for beginners and speedy developers keen on mobile app development.

> It is a framework and a platform for universal React applications.

> It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

### You will build a simple mobile app that allows:

- Image selection from the device's photo library
- Image overlay with emoji
- Animated and ReAnimated components
- Save the result to the device's photo library

## To run the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/engagepy/stickersmash-first-reactnative.git

cd stickersmash-first-reactnative

npx install

npx expo start
```

## Beginners shocked with terminal options on server launch ?

```bash
i - for ios simulator

a - for android simulator

w - for web simulator
```

> Important to note that web requires image saving via dom-to-image, and such nuances in platforms require packages to be installed in the project. This is why you see the package.json file with all the dependencies.
